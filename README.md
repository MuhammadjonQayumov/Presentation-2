>What is a object in JavaScript ? 

In JavaScript, an object is a standalone
entity, with properties and type.
Compare it with a cup, for example. A
cup is an object, with properties. A cup
has a color, a design, weight, a material
it is made of, etc. The same way,
JavaScript objects can have properties,
which define their characteristics.
Everything is an object in JavaScript.
