>Function – Declaration

• A function is declared using the function keyword.

• The basic rules of naming a function are similar to naming a variable. It is 
better to write a descriptive name for your function. For example, if a 
function is used to add two numbers, you could name the function add or 
addNumbers

• The body of function is written within {}.

 In previous page , we have declared a function named 
greet(). To use that function, we need to call it.
 
 Here's how you can call the above greet() function.


>Function – Expression

  Variable x is used to store the function. 
Here the function is treated as an 
expression. And the function is called 
using the variable name.

  The function is called an anonymous 
function.
